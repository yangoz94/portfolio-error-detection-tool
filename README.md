# (Functional Programming) Porfolio Error Detection Tool 

This functional project was developed for a class project to better experience the practical differences between functional programming and OOP. 

The goal of the project is to assist language instructors with student portfolio feedback by automatically capturing grammar, vocabulary and spelling errors without explicitly correcting the mistakes. Captured errors are marked with the specific type of the error rather than explicit answers so students can put in the effort to correct them in the subsequent drafts.

- The project can easily be deployed to Streamlit(Heroku).
